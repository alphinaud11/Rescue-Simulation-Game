# Rescue Simulation Game
The Rescue Simulation is based on concepts of the RoboCup, an annual international robotics competition proposed and founded in 1996 by a group of university professors. The GUC has been taking part in this competition for few years and won various titles including the best team. The aim of rescue simulations is to derive strategies and behaviors for maximizing the number of saved lives and minimizing the number of casualties. The hope is that one day these strategies can be applied by actual policemen, firefighters and medics in real life disasters and accidents.

The code utilizes OOP concepts, MVC pattern, and is written in Java.
